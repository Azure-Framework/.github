**vMenu-Driven â€¢ Lightweight â€¢ Modular**

Welcome to **Azure Framework**, a minimalist FiveM server framework built around [vMenu](https://github.com/TomGrobben/vMenu) and Discord integration. Skip the bloatâ€”only include the features you need, instantly.

---

ðŸŒŸ **Key Highlights**

- **Auto Schema**: Your database tables auto-create on first runâ€”no migrations, no headaches.
- **vMenu Integration**: Seamlessly inject economy, departments, jail, and stats into vMenuâ€™s existing UI.
- **Discord-Powered Permissions**: Sync roles from your Discord guild for in-game permissions and admin access.
- **Modular Architecture**: Enable just the modules you need: Economy, Departments, Jail, Player Stats, and more.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for minimal resource usage.

3. **Start the resource**

-- How often to run distributePaychecks (in milliseconds)
Config.paycheckInterval = 3600000  -- 1 hour
